Hi! I'm Tosh.

I am a Computer Engineering student with strong interests in big data and free software aspiring to a career in Data Engineering.
I love simple and sustainable technologies, football, powerlifting and playing indie games.

Intrigued by the idea of [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), I use this website as my primary hub for online identity and communication.

## Brain Dumps
My attempts at writing about anything and everything that I find interesting.
