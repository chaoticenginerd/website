I have been pretty busy over the past few weeks due to a lot of schoolwork and tests to take care of but things have slowed down enough this week, to the point where I can properly reflect on recent happenings.
So I have decided to take some time to write about some new apps that I have been trying ever since I switched over to KDE.

## Keepass
I started using keepass in an attempt to move away from cloud based password managers.
I have been using Bitwarden and while it has been working really well, I have decided to use an offline password manager so that I get to store the password database as I see fit and don't have to trust an online service to do it for me.
I am using KeePassXC as my keepass client and have no complaints so far.

## Kmail
I have been using web based email clients for as long as I can remember.
But after getting my own email and generating a pair of GPG keys, I decided to try out some desktop email clients.
Kmail is the email client for the KDE desktop.
It looks much better than most email clients, has a ton of features and signing and encrypting emails is a breeze ;).
One downside of Kmail is that it pulls in almost all dependencies of the KDE PIM suite and hence is quite large (~170mb).

## Mumble
Mumble is an extremely simple program, that focuses on two things: voice and text chat, and does them well.
It can be self-hosted and is extremely lightweight and resource efficient.
I don't have my mumble server (yet) and I have been using [Volatile](https://volatile.bz/)'s public servers and I am really enjoying it.

## Neochat
I have never been a fan of Element.
While it has a ton of features, it never worked well for me and was sluggish and resource heavy which is to be expected since it is built using electron.
Neochat is a matrix client from the KDE project and so it integrates well with my desktop.
It implements a large part of the matrix protocol with the exception of end-to-end encryption, but most of the matrix communities that I am a part of don't have end-to-end encryption anyway.

There are plenty of other apps that I have tried and started using after switching to KDE but these are the major ones that came to my mind.
