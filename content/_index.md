Hi! I'm Tosh, a Computer Engineering student with strong interests in data, free software and privacy aspiring to a career in Data Engineering.

I love simple and sustainable technologies, football, powerlifting and playing indie games.

Intrigued by the idea of [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), I use this website as my primary hub for online identity and communication.

If you have any questions, comments or just want to chat, feel free to reach out to me at **tosh** [at] **chaoticenginerd.com**.
Elsewhere on the internet, you can find me on the [Fediverse](https://fosstodon.org/@chaoticenginerd), [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/chaoticenginerd), and on [Github](https://github.com/chaoticenginerd).
